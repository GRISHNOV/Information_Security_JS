# Description of cryptographic algorithms

## Basic algorithms

This project includes some basic algorithms, such as:

- Caesar cipher
- Monoalphabetic cipher
- Polyalphabetic (Vigen√®re) cipher
- Bigram (Porta's with an additional shift) cipher

More information about basic methods are available in [`src/libmethods/encryption/basic` folder](https://github.com/denisstasyev/Information_Security_JS/tree/master/src/libmethods/encryption/basic).

## Block algorithms

This project includes some block algorithms, such as:

- AES-256
- GOST

More information about block methods are available in [`src/libmethods/encryption/block` folder](https://github.com/denisstasyev/Information_Security_JS/tree/master/src/libmethods/encryption/block).

## Asymmetric algorithms

This project includes some asymmetric algorithms, such as:

- RSA

More information about asymmetric methods are available in [`src/libmethods/encryption/asymmetric` folder](https://github.com/denisstasyev/Information_Security_JS/tree/master/src/libmethods/encryption/asymmetric).
